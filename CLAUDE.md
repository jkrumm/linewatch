# linewatch — Claude Code Instructions

Uptime + throughput history for the home internet line. Mac mini only. Read
[`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) before changing anything structural — it
carries the measurements the design rests on, not just the design.

## The one fact that must not be forgotten

**ICMP inside a container on this host is fabricated.** Colima's NAT answers echo
requests itself, including for RFC 5737 black-hole addresses. Verified
2026-07-30, `--network host` included. Any future "let's simplify by moving the
collector into the container" produces a dashboard that reports perfect uptime
forever and is silently wrong.

TCP connect from a container *is* honest (`192.0.2.1:443` correctly times out),
so a TCP-based probe is the legitimate fallback if ICMP ever becomes awkward.
Throughput through the VM is unaffected, so speed tests belong in the container.

## Shape

| Piece | Where | Why |
|-|-|-|
| `collector/{probe,ping-parser,vantage}.ts` | native, launchd | real ICMP + the host's own vantage; no npm deps |
| API + SQLite + Ookla + router poll + UI | Docker (`:7731`) | restart policy, rollhook CD |

The collector POSTs batches with a bearer token and **spools to
`collector/spool.jsonl` on failure**, replaying on the next successful cycle. Do
not "simplify" the spool away — without it every redeploy writes a fake outage
into the record.

**The database is in the `linewatch-data` named Docker volume and the host
cannot open it.** Read it with `make db-counts` / `make db-shell`, never by
opening the file — [`docs/storage.md`](docs/storage.md) has the rule, the
corruption that forced it, and the backup/restore targets.

## Boot order trap, already hit once

`src/db/client.ts` runs migrations **at module load**, not from a statement in
`src/index.ts`. ES imports are evaluated before any statement in the importing
module's body, so a `runMigrations()` call at the top of `index.ts` still runs
after every transitively imported module — including
`services/outage-detector-instance.ts`, which queries at module scope. On a fresh
database that ordering crashed the process with `no such table: outage`, and the
test suite did not catch it because tests use a pre-migrated DB. Keep migration
an invariant of importing the client.

## Conventions

- Bearer auth on the two routes that write to the historical record: `POST
  /api/probes` and `POST /api/interventions`. Everything else is open on the
  tailnet — including `POST /api/speedtests/run`, which is a dashboard button
  with no token to present and is **rate-limited instead** (429 within
  `speedtestMinIntervalS`, 5 min by default, measured against the newest
  `speed_test` row so a container restart cannot reset it). Saturating the line
  is its only abuse and the limit caps that. `grep -rn hasValidBearer src/` is
  the source of truth; keep this list in sync with it.
- `GET /api/probes` **must** bucket in SQL, and so must any new range route.
  Never return raw rows for a long range — `probe_sample` grows ~4.2M rows/year.
  The router range routes cap with an explicit `limit` instead.
- Outages are materialised on write by `services/outage-detector.ts`, not derived
  on read. Single-cycle blips are recorded honestly and filtered in the UI.
- `probe_cycle` records what each cycle measured **through** — default-route
  interface, path class, negotiated media/link speed/duplex, gateway, NIC error
  counters. `on_home_line` is three-state: 1 / 0 / **null = unknown**. Never
  coalesce null to 1 on a read path, and never default an unparseable field to a
  plausible value; that fabrication is the exact bug the table exists to prevent.
  `ts` is UNIQUE so a spool replay is idempotent.
- `link_change` events are materialised on write, like outages — by the probe
  ingest when the host-side vantage changes, and by the router poller from the
  carrier side. `intervention` is written by `POST /api/interventions`.
  `config_change` and `note` are still unwritten; the `event` table stays the
  extension point for phase-2 router control (TP-Link reconnect, LAN↔WLAN
  failover) so it needs no migration.
- The router poller is **read-only** against the router, and no schema table
  stores a MAC. This is a public repo: no real MAC, hostname, ISP name, city,
  public IP or credential in tracked files, fixtures and tests included.
- The dashboard's fetch layer has a single `USE_MOCK` switch. Keep it working;
  it is how the UI is developed before real data accumulates.

## Validation

`make check` (typecheck + `bun test`). The ping parser is tested against real
macOS `ping` output fixtures — including the 100%-loss case, where `ping` **exits
non-zero and prints no round-trip summary line**. That is a valid measurement,
not an error; never gate on the exit code.

Drive containers via `make`, never raw `docker` (the global docker-makefile rule,
and a hook enforces it).
